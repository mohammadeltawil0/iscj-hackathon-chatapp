# iscj-hackathon-chatapp
## Problem statement
* This our ISCJ Hackathon submission<br>
* The current chat apps are centralized and subject to misuse by powerful people. <br> 
* These chat apps lack privacy because companies can access your data. <br>
* Algorithms push questionable content to younger ages.  <br>
* Proprietary and censorship are the two main issues with these current chat apps. <br>

## Proposal
* We want to make an ISCJ social media app<br>
* Messaging should be less chaotic and have a more decentralized architecture.  (This means that 
  we need to move away from run of the mill apps like Instagram, Facebook, etc.) <br>
* This app helps the community by creating a more centralized form of communication.<br>
